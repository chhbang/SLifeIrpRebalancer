# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository status

All five screens are functional end-to-end: HTML/CSV import → account input → sell-decision → AI proposal → PDF export. State (account + catalog + settings) auto-persists across launches. The Core library is covered by 27 xUnit tests against the real reference HTML.

Design docs are in Korean. Source of truth: [doc/SLifeIrpRebalancer_상세_설계서.md](doc/SLifeIrpRebalancer_상세_설계서.md) (Gemini-generated from the user's brief in [doc/prompt.txt](doc/prompt.txt)). A real saved snapshot of the Samsung Life product page lives at [reference/퇴직연금 전체 상품 - 퇴직연금 - 삼성생명.html](reference/퇴직연금%20전체%20상품%20-%20퇴직연금%20-%20삼성생명.html) and is used by the parser tests. A sample of the kind of proposal the AI should return is in [doc/삼성생명 IRP 펀드 리밸런싱 전략 제안.md](doc/삼성생명%20IRP%20펀드%20리밸런싱%20전략%20제안.md) — useful as a target for prompt design and PDF layout.

The user's actual implementation choices have diverged from the original Gemini-generated spec in two notable places — see "Cross-cutting constraints" below. Treat the spec as historical context, not an authoritative bible.

```

The `Core` library is deliberately framework-free — parser, CSV, AI clients, prompt builder, PDF generator are all testable from the CLI without spinning up WinUI. The WinUI app references Core via `ProjectReference`.

## Build, test, run

```pwsh
# Restore + build everything (Core, Tests, WinUI app)
dotnet build SLifeIrpRebalancer.slnx -p:Platform=x64

# Run all 27 unit tests — preferred for fast iteration on Core
dotnet test tests/SLifeIrpRebalancer.Core.Tests/SLifeIrpRebalancer.Core.Tests.csproj

# Run the WinUI app
dotnet build SLifeIrpRebalancer/SLifeIrpRebalancer.csproj -p:Platform=x64
# Then F5 in Visual Studio. `dotnet run` does NOT work for packaged WinUI 3 apps.
```

The WinUI 3 app cannot be launched via `dotnet run` because it is packaged (MSIX). Use Visual Studio's debugger, or for a one-off non-deployment run, build then execute the produced `.exe` from `SLifeIrpRebalancer/bin/x64/Debug/net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0/win-x64/`.

## What the app does

`SLifeIrpRebalancer` is a Windows desktop app that produces AI-generated rebalancing proposals for a Samsung Life Insurance IRP (개인형 퇴직연금 / Korean individual retirement pension) account:

1. **Data preparation.** User imports the Samsung Life product-list HTML (or pre-exported CSVs) → app parses into `ProductCatalog` (principal-guaranteed + funds, with dynamic 수익률(N개월/년) columns). Multiple HTML snapshots can be merged by product code to populate all five return periods.
2. **Account input.** User enters total balance + per-holding amounts. AutoSuggestBox feeds from the parsed catalog.
3. **Sell decisions + timing.** Per holding: `IsSellable` checkbox (default true). At account level: 즉시 vs 만기 예약 radio + execution date picker (only when 만기 예약).
4. **AI proposal.** App builds a structured Korean markdown prompt and queries Claude / Gemini / GPT via the user's API key. Response renders in WebView2 via Markdig.
5. **PDF export.** QuestPDF walks the Markdig AST to produce a structured PDF with header, account/sell-decision tables, and the AI body — Korean text via Malgun Gothic.

## Architecture

- **Platform:** WinUI 3 Blank App (Packaged), .NET 8 (`net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0`), C# + XAML, Visual Studio 2026, Windows App SDK 2.0.1.
- **Pattern:** MVVM via `CommunityToolkit.Mvvm`. The 5 screens are hosted in a single `NavigationView` shell.
- **Libraries:**
  - `HtmlAgilityPack` — Samsung Life HTML parsing
  - `Markdig` — markdown → HTML / AST
  - `QuestPDF` — PDF generation (Community license, set in `App.xaml.cs`)
  - `HttpClient` + `System.Text.Json` — AI REST calls (no provider SDKs)
  - `CommunityToolkit.Mvvm` — ObservableObject, ObservableProperty
- **Five screens:** Settings (AI provider + API key, lifelong-annuity flag) → Data Preparation (HTML/CSV → catalog) → My Account → Sell Targets & Timing → AI Rebalance.

### Cross-cutting constraints

These shaped the design materially and are easy to miss when reading code in isolation:

- **운용사 (asset manager) is load-bearing.** If the user checks "lifelong annuity payout" in Settings, the prompt must constrain the AI to recommend only products where 운용사 contains "삼성생명" or "삼성". See the parser section below — extraction differs between funds and principal-guaranteed products.
- **Per-holding `IsSellable` flag, not granular sell amounts.** The user marks which holdings are off-limits ("절대 매도하지 않을 상품"); everything else is in the AI's pool to size on its own. The prompt hard-constrains the AI to never sell holdings where `IsSellable == false`. This intentionally diverges from the original spec (which had FullSell / PartialSell / Keep with explicit sell amounts) — the AI is the expert on sizing, the user only sets boundaries.
- **Rebalance timing + execution date.** The 즉시 vs 만기 예약 radio is required. When MaturityReservation is selected, `AccountStatusModel.ExecutionDate` (DateOnly) is also required and represents the planned execution date — typically the maturity date of the product that triggered the rebalance. Both flow into the prompt as framing.

### HTML parser — what the saved page actually looks like

A real saved snapshot is checked in at [reference/퇴직연금 전체 상품 - 퇴직연금 - 삼성생명.html](reference/퇴직연금%20전체%20상품%20-%20퇴직연금%20-%20삼성생명.html). It is a Vue SSR dump from `samsunglife.com/.../MDP-MYRET080910M`. Key facts that diverge from the spec — read these before touching the parser:

- **No `<table>` tags.** Products are rendered as `<li class="data-list-item">` cards. Iterate `li.data-list-item` instead of table rows. Both lists (principal-guaranteed and funds) use the *same* card class — distinguish them by the badge inside `p.flag-group`: principal-guaranteed cards contain `<span class="flag badge gray">원리금보장형</span>`; funds carry a risk-grade badge like `<span class="flag badge grade1">매우높은위험</span>` plus an asset-class badge (`위험자산` / `안정자산`).
- **Product code lives in the cart checkbox** at `input[name="productCheckCart"]`'s `id` / `value` — e.g. `C02011`, `G04783`, `C03049`. Both `C` and `G` prefixes appear for both product types, so do *not* infer category from the code prefix.
- **Product name** is `a.desc-title > strong`. **Applied rate / return value** is `ul.desc-list li.desc-item div.desc span` (last `<span>` — there can be a tooltip button before it).
- **Funds expose 운용사 explicitly** at `div.desc-sum > span:first-child` (e.g. `미래에셋자산운용㈜`, `한화자산운용`). Read it directly. The spec's "extract manager from product name prefix" approach is wrong for funds.
- **Principal-guaranteed products do *not* have `desc-sum`.** 운용사 is derived from the product name prefix via `AssetManagerResolver` (small mapping table for `메리츠`, `푸본현대생명`, `고려저축은행`, etc.). For Samsung Life's own products like `이율보증형(3년)` (no recognizable prefix), it falls back to `삼성생명`.
- **Maturity term (만기) for principal-guaranteed is embedded in the name**, not a separate field. Multiple formats appear: `(IRP 3년)` suffix, `1년_IRP` suffix (with leading space in source), `이율보증형(3년)`. Regex `(\d+)\s*년` over the name is sufficient.
- **Applied rate may carry a parenthesised second number**, e.g. `3.65%(3.78%)`. The first is annual compound, the second (in parens) is the simple-interest equivalent. We store the first.
- **Critical: only ONE return-period populates per saved HTML.** Each fund card carries exactly one `<em>수익률(N개월)</em>` row, where N is whatever sort the user had selected when they saved (the radio options are 1개월/3개월/6개월/1년/3년). To populate all five columns of the fund CSV, the user must save and import five separate snapshots; `ProductCatalogMerger` folds them by product code. The spec implies all periods come from one file — they don't. The Data Preparation screen has a "다른 기간 HTML 추가 머지" button to surface this.

### Data models

Live in `src/SLifeIrpRebalancer.Core/Models/`:

- `AccountStatusModel` — `TotalAmount` (required), `DepositAmount?`, `ProfitAmount?`, `RebalanceTiming`, `ExecutionDate?` (DateOnly, required when timing is MaturityReservation), `OwnedItems: List<OwnedProductModel>`.
- `OwnedProductModel` — `ProductName`, `CurrentValue` (required), optional `ReturnRate`, `AnnualizedReturn`, `InvestedDays`, `TotalShares`, plus `IsSellable` (default true; false locks the holding from the AI's sell pool).
- `PrincipalGuaranteedProduct`, `FundProduct`, `ProductCatalog` — output of the parser. `FundProduct.Returns` is `IReadOnlyDictionary<ReturnPeriod, string>` so a single-snapshot import populates only one entry per fund (see HTML parser section above).

## Persistence

Three independent stores keep state across launches; the Reset buttons are screen-scoped on purpose so the user can wipe one slice without touching the others.

| Slice | Backing store | Path | Save trigger | Reset trigger |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AI provider, API key, lifelong-annuity flag | `Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.LocalSettings` | per-user package settings | every property setter (immediate) | manual edit on Settings page (no reset button) |
| Catalog | `StateStore` → JSON in `LocalFolder/catalog.json` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\<pfn>\LocalState\` | `AppState.Catalog` setter via `OnCatalogChanged` partial method | "카탈로그 초기화" button on Data Preparation (with ContentDialog confirm) |
| Account (totals, OwnedItems with IsSellable, RebalanceTiming, ExecutionDate) | `StateStore` → JSON in `LocalFolder/account.json` | same | every VM mutation calls `AppState.Instance.SaveAccount()` (My Account VM + Sell Targets VM, including row PropertyChanged) | "계좌 정보 초기화" button on My Account (with ContentDialog confirm) |

`AppState.Instance` is a process-wide singleton that loads both snapshots in its constructor. Catalog round-trips through a private DTO (`CatalogDto` / `FundProductDto`) inside `StateStore.cs` because `IReadOnlyList<T>` and `Dictionary<ReturnPeriod, string>` don't deserialize cleanly through System.Text.Json defaults. Best-effort I/O — corrupt JSON snapshots are silently ignored on load and the app starts fresh, rather than crashing.

When wiring a new VM that mutates `AppState.Account`, remember to call `AppState.Instance.SaveAccount()` after the mutation. Catalog is automatic.

## Working notes

- **Korean is the user-facing language.** UI strings, error messages, prompts to the AI, and PDF content should be Korean. Code identifiers stay English.
- **API keys** are stored in plain text in LocalSettings (per-user, package-isolated). For multi-user/shared-machine scenarios, migrate to `Windows.Security.Credentials.PasswordVault` — a comment in `SettingsService.cs` flags this.
- **AI model defaults** are hardcoded in each client (`AnthropicClient.DefaultModel = "claude-opus-4-7"`, `OpenAiClient.DefaultModel = "gpt-5"`, `GeminiClient.DefaultModel = "gemini-2.5-pro"`). To switch models without surfacing a UI selector, edit the `DefaultModel` constant or pass a `model` argument to the constructor.
- **CommunityToolkit.Mvvm partial-property AOT warnings (MVVMTK0045)** are suppressed via `<NoWarn>$(NoWarn);MVVMTK0045</NoWarn>` in the WinUI csproj. The newer partial-property syntax was tried and didn't bind to the source generator in this combo (.NET 10 SDK + net8 target + WindowsAppSDK 2.0.1) — re-investigate when bumping the toolkit or moving the WinUI app to net9/net10.
- **WinUI 3 file/folder pickers** need the main window's HWND or they crash. Always go through `WindowHelper.Initialize(picker, App.Window)` from `Services/WindowHelper.cs`.
- **PasswordBox.Password is intentionally not bindable** in WinUI 3 (security policy) — set the initial value imperatively in the View constructor and forward changes through `PasswordChanged` (see `SettingsView.xaml.cs`).
